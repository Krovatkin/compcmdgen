### How to Use

* Prepend the path to this folder to `$PATH`
* Each compile command will generate its own command file with the default prefix "comp_"
* Change the default prefix by setting `COMPDB_PREFIX` to `custom_prefix_`
* Compile a project w/ `make`. Caveat if a compiler is referred to a full path it won't work
* Run `python merge.py`
